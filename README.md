# Typescript_Practice
This is TypeScript practice that I am implementing in my code now. 

# Overview 
In this repository you will find files that I made to implement TypeScript which works in connection with JavaScript. The JavaScript compilier sompiles the TypeScript file.

# Prequisites
- Node.js
- TypeScript

# Step 1 
Install node @ nodejs.org
I always intall the reccommended version.

Then in your terminal, go to the correct directory and check your node version

    node -v
    
After that, Install Typescript.

    npm install -g typescript
    
Now you are ready to run the program(s).

run in your terminal:

        main.ts
        
The JavaScript compiler does something to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript and creates a JavaScript file(main.js). Then the compiler runs that JavaScript code.
